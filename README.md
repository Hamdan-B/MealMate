## About MealMate

MealMate is a React app that helps you generate delicious meals and their recipes based on the ingredients you have at home. Just enter your available ingredients, select a cuisine type, and MealMate will suggest dishes you can make. If you're missing any ingredients, the app will also provide a complete list needed for each recipe.

### Key Features

- **AI-Powered Meal Generation:** Uses Gemini AI to suggest dishes and recipes from your ingredients and selected cuisine.
- **Ingredient Completion:** Tells you what extra ingredients you need if youâ€™re missing any.
- **Meal Scheduling:** Generate meal schedules for 3, 5, or 7 days, with three meals per day (breakfast, lunch, dinner) based on your chosen cuisine.
- **Personal Account:** Save, update, or delete your generated schedules in your account.
- **Authentication & Database:** Uses Firebase Auth for secure login and Firestore for storing your schedules.
